# latex-make
A simple and sane makefile for latex documents

This is really hard, but now it works fairly well.  It could probably be made
more elegant, but I don't know how.  

## To Do:
- fix issue with not building properly with default target if target does not already exist
- Investigate building in a separate directory
- General elegance improvements
